Examples are in two formats: CIF and Jmol PNGJ (a PNG image that can be dropped into Jmol to give an interactive model; Jmol 14.32.78 or later should be used). These images for the most part reproduce the images 
in the chapter, which were made using ToposPro, not Jmol.

example_1: diamond (atomic network)
example_2: lithium tetracarbonyl-cobalt (polyatomic node, two interpenetrating nets)
example_3: calcium carbonate (calcite; polyatomic node)
example_4: copper(I) oxide  (two interpenetrating nets with molecular linker)
example_5: MOF-5 (multiple nets; two polyatomic nodes and a molecular linker)
example_6: cyanamide (simple atomic network example with hydrogen bonding)

example_7: FAU zeolite tiling example (not in chapter; see more/ directory)

save_TOPOL	
    The TOPOL category covers data on connectivity	
    between atoms and structural groups and the	
    related structural properties as calculated from	
    the ATOM, CELL and SPACE_GROUP data.	
save_TOPOLOGY	
    This category is the parent of all categories in the dictionary.	
save_TOPOL_ATOM	
    The TOPOL_ATOM category provides information on the atoms of the initial	
    structure that compose links or nodes of a net. The _topol_atom.atom_label	
    value must match a value in ATOM_SITE.label.	
save_TOPOL_ENTANGL	
    The TOPOL_ENTANGL category describes entanglements in the	
    underlying net.  This category is a placeholder for future development	
    of descriptions of entanglement.	
save_TOPOL_LINK	
    The TOPOL_LINK category describes the crystal structure	
    connectivity and encodes the weighted colored	
    symmetry-labeled quotient graph, from which the whole	
    periodic net describing the overall topology of the crystal	
    structure can be restored. The definition of	
    symmetry-labeled quotient graph was given by Klein (1996)	
    and examples of weights and colors for the graph edges and	
    vertices are provided by Blatov (2006). The	
    connections described in TOPOL_LINK may correspond to any	
    vectors in the structure, not just bonds or contacts. The	
    nodes that are linked are listed in TOPOL_NODE. In	
    order to properly describe the connectivity,	
    _topol_link.atom_label_1 and _topol_link.atom_label_2 (for atoms) or	
    _topol_link.node_id_1 and _topol_link.node_id_2 (for nodes) must be given	
    for each link, which is identified by _topol_link.id. Other	
    items in this category are optional. The atoms composing	
    the link should be specified in the TOPOL_ATOM list.

    analysis of crystal structures. Acta Cryst. A62, 356-364.

    The TOPOL_NET category describes an underlying net, its	
    topological properties and occurrence in other structures.

save_TOPOL_NODE	
    The TOPOL_NODE category describes the chemical composition,	
    structure and topological properties of the nodes of the underlying	
    net. If the node correspond to an atom from the ATOM_SITE list the link	
    _topol_node.atom_label should be used to refer to the atom. If the node	
    is polyatomic, its TOPOL_NODE.id must match a value in TOPOL_ATOM.node_id.

save_TOPOL_OCCURRENCE	
    The TOPOL_OCCURRENCE category lists the appearances of the	
    underlying net topology in crystal structures.	
save_TOPOL_TILING	
    The TOPOL_TILING category describes the natural tiling	
    corresponding to the underlying net.  A tiling is a	
    partition of crystal space using generalised polyhedra, and a	
    natural tiling is one for which tiles are the smallest possible	
    that conserve the full symmetry of the net and for which the	
    faces are all locally strong rings. This means that there is no	
    single largest face (face with the largest number of vertices)	
    as such a face will be the sum of the other smaller faces.	
	
    The tile signature contains the sizes of the tile faces and	
    the number of faces of a given size in the tile.

save_TOPOL_TILING_FACES	
    The TOPOL_TILING_FACES category tabulates the faces	
    belonging to each tile in the tiling.  Together with the	
    TOPOL_TILING_TILE category it tabulates the information	
    contained in _topol_tiling.signature. See the	
    TOPOL_TILING category for further information.	
save_TOPOL_TILING_TILE	
    The TOPOL_TILING_TILE category provides information on	
    each of the tiles in the tiling. Together with the	
    TOPOL_TILING_FACES category it tabulates the information

    Note that this association is in a bridging sense, not

    ATOM_SITE.label when the node is associated with exactly one atom.

    shortest rings come first. For 4-coordinated nodes only, the

    to an item described in the core CITATION category. If a publication	
    and database entry are not directly related, they should be listed	
    in separate rows.	
save_topol_occurrence.id	
    A unique identifier for the literature or database reference.	
save_topol_occurrence.net_id	
    The identifier of the net, which topology occurrence is described.	
save_topol_tiling.dsize	
    The number of distinct (not symmetry-related) chambers in the	
    tiling.	
save_topol_tiling.dual	
    The overall topology symbol of the dual net, which  corresponds	
    to the net of the dual of the natural tiling.	
save_topol_tiling.edges	
    The number of independent tile edges in the natural tiling.	
save_topol_tiling.faces	
    The number of independent tile faces in the natural tiling.	
save_topol_tiling.signature	
    The tiling signature, written in the form	
    \a[A^a^ . B^b^ ...]+\b[C^c^ . D^d^ ...]+...,	
    where square brackets envelop tile symbols, \a,\b,... are stoichiometric	
    coefficients, A, B, C, D, ... are sizes of tile faces, a,b,c,d, ... are	
    numbers of the faces of a given size in the tile.	
save_topol_tiling.tiles	
    The number of independent tiles in the natural tiling.	
save_topol_tiling.vertices	
    The number of independent tile vertices in the natural tiling.	
save_topol_tiling_faces.count	
    The number of faces of this size in the tile.	
save_topol_tiling_faces.size	
    The size of the tile face.	
save_topol_tiling_faces.tile_id	
    The tile to which this face belongs. It must be one of the values provided	
    in _topol_tiling_tile.id.	
save_topol_tiling_tile.count	
    The number of this kind of tile in the tiling.	
save_topol_tiling_tile.id	
    An arbitrary unique identifier for this tile type.
